# auto-enumeration-basic
A very rudimentary program to take user input and perform various enumeration on a target machine. Mainly to be used for CTF's, Vulnerable VM's (Vuln Hub) and various small projects. Also just a little project to help me practice basic programming. If you have any ideas or recommendations - please feel free to comment or message! 

Usage: ./basic_enum.sh
